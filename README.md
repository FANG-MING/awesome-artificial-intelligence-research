# Awesome Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a huge research area with tens of thousands papers published every year, and it's more and more difficult to track a specific topic among many top conferences and jurnals. The aim of this list is to maintain a meta list of up-to-date research paper lists to help researchers to get familar with cutting edge researchs in a certain area. The main difference of this list comparing with other existing AI or ML list is that this list is oriented to researchers (that are seeking new papers), so we will not try to include related courses, books or video lectures as many other existing lists.

Please consider to contribute to this list by openning an issue with recommended awesome paper list.
